# Pokemon_GO_ML

In this machine learning project we used close to 300,000 rows of data, from a Pokemon_Go data set, to predict the best way for you to find the pokemon you are looking for. 

We used a CatBoost classification model, and then used the top features returned by CatBoost as our way to help you find the pokemon you are looking for.

# Happy hunting!
